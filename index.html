<h4> Blue Jays 2015 Season?</h4>

h4 greates a relatively smaller heading, so it doesn't take away from the main heading of h1

<p> The Toronto Blue Jays began their season off to a slow start with many players playing together for the first time which caused distruptions during games. However, the season lit up after the All-Star game in July. Players were added and some were traded away and this made all the difference. After 22 years, the Blue Jays made it to the post season and almost became the "American Leauge Champion".
